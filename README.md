My attempts to do something on kaggle

## Playground s3e2 - Jan 10, 2023
Task was to predict if person will have a stroke. Used DenseNetwork and rewised basics of Deep Learning. Beat benchmark and that's all. Didn't try to tune parameters because didn't wanted to. My best submission on public wart was 87% accuracy. 

The first approach was to use DenseNetwork straightforward but I failed to reach benchmark because it was unbalanced binary classification problem and my model lazily predicted that nobody would have stroke. Then, to fix this, I used WeightedRandomSampler and gave weight inversely proportional to the probability of stroke and monitored balanced accuracy while training.

## Digit Recognition - Jan 11, 2023
This one is more interesting. Dataset contained 28x28 handwritten digits and task was to train model to distinguish them. Predicted it using CNN with Dropout and resulted in 99% accuracy.

Then, created small app, where you can draw digit and the model predicts which digit it is. Had some problem: 1) We trained model on digits written in grayscale, whule I use black-and-white in app, so had to retrain it (Noteworthy, this one gives 98% accuracy on test set); 2) Model is trained on small images while I draw them 400x400 in app and then resize them using linear interpolation. Moreover, not sure about thickness of digits, so model works poor on '6' and '9'. Perhaps, should try training it on more complicated dataset.


## Disaster Recognition by Tweets - Jan 18, 2023
I wanted to do something about NLP because it seemed to be feasible for my PC. That was true but the problem itself was quite complicated. Most of the feature engineering was copied from someone's kaggle notebook and can be used in the future because of good plots. Struggled a few days trying to rewrite BERT used in notebook to torch but failed. I have to revisit this problem later and spend some time researching NLP solutions and examples.

After all, decided just to use sum of embeddings and use DenseNetwork then. Results are around 80% what is not bad but also not so good. 

Note: stop refering to Deep Learning models as to magic sticks. Have to do something with "Shallow Learning" models too.


## Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning - Jan 21, 2023
The first course I complited on kaggle and the first certificate (yay! right before my bd).

The content is actually mid because I wrote only a few lines of code and they were very simple, but for basic understanding, it is enough, I guess. I liked RL very much and would like to do something more about it; perhaps, I should try watching lectures of London University which were recommended in the last lesson. 

## [RL course by David Silver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ) - Feb 23, 2023

As I suggested, started watching great course from University College London. Unfortunately, had to make a little pause because of the beggining of a new term. However, I watched 4 lectures of the course just before that, and only month later started doing assignment.

It took time to finish it, but I memorized concepts we met on the lectures and done a great job. After finishing assignment, I wanted to compare my work to the results of other students and find out that there was a little done dilligently: some of the had errors as value function being more than 1 (while it cannot be more than reward), too big MSE, not checking behavior of TD function on lambda = 1, etc. I believe my results are correct. However, I have to admit that copied answers to the last 5 open questions from [here](https://github.com/kvfrans/Easy21-RL) ðŸ™ˆ. Other parts are done by me and sometimes code is too sloppy, lacks routine and readability, but the most important thing is results - pictures.

Now, I unlocked next lectures for me, and will spend time to watch them parallel to my study at University. Also, attached notes of the lectures.

## March 30, 2023

Took some time to complete the course because of university. Managed to complete all lectures and write the final paper, scored 28/40 what is not bad for a person who wasn't preparing (but used notes when writing). Now, I want to try to apply this knowledge in creating some reinforcement learning model of soccer. Hope, it will work. Hope, it will not take half a year.
